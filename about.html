<h1>Our Story</h1>

 <section class="intro">
<p>
  Our company started back in 2012 in our small apartment in downtown providence. It began as a dog walking business but slowly evolved as we realized that we could make it even better. With the help of a few family members spreading the word we got our first party…and it took off from there. 
</p>
<p>
  All of our animals have been certified in order to ensure the safety of all of our customers. Through this process we learn what type of events that each animal is suited for. This way you are always guaranteed the best experience with our services.
</p>
<p>
  Our mission is to  spread happiness and joy in the stressful lives that we all live today. We can guarantee that we can brighten up your day one paw at a time.
</p>
<p>
  According to the ADAA (The Anxiety and Depression Association of America) it is proven that being in contact with pets puts people at ease. Most pet owners consider their pets to be family and treat them as such. It is also proven that 75% of pet owners report mental health improvements not only for them but also the people around them. We want to bring that happiness to you! Even if we are only there for a couple hours or the whole day, we want to end your event with smiles on everyone’s face.

   <p>"I hired Lease Em' and Leash Em' as a surprise for my office back in September. It was during a very rough period in our company’s history, and I believed everyone needed a day to relax. Bruce brought so much happiness to our office that everyone still talks about it to this day. We will definitely be using Lease Em' and Leash Em' next year!"</p>

   <p>"For my daughters 4th birthday we had a cat themed party because it was her favorite animal. Lease Em' and Leash Em' helped make her party even better with their service. I will never forget the look on my daughter’s face when we brought out Lulu. The cat was great with all the kids and her handler was exceptionally professional. Can't wait for my next opportunity to use this service!"</p>
